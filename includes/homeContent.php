			<p>We are 'vanlife' campervanning novices. After recently purchasing our first campervan, we're spending the summer of 2022 travelling around Europe.</p>
			<p>If you're after advice from experienced 'vanlifers', this might not be the blog for you. But, if you'd like to follow us, a couple of beginners, on our journey (both mental and geographical) as we blog our way through France, Spain, Italy and many other countries, then keep reading.</p>
			<p>We'll share hints, tips, pictures and recipes along the way of the good, the bad and the ugly - if we can help other novices out there, then even better!</p>
