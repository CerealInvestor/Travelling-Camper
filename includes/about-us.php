			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<p>Travelling around Europe has always been an aspiration of ours and last year I sold my house and bought a campervan. The Instagram picture perfect, freedom loving ‘vanlife’ hashtag only “slightly” influencing my decision!</p>

			<p>Along with my partner, we are embarking on a three month tour of Europe this summer. I would like to call it a holiday, but after trying to cram nearly every European country into our itinerary, I think we need to position it more as an expedition! It will definitely be a balancing act to make sure we also explore the paths less trodden, and if there’s time, relax.</p>

			<p>We’ll share our movements and blog about the good, the bad and ugly – with only a few freedom loving, Instagram perfect ‘vanlife’ pictures (if they’re even possible with my three year old Huawei phone camera).</p>

			<p>We’ll share hints and tips along the way as we live and travel full time in our campervan and make our way over many, many borders in a post Brexit and Covid world. Even as I’m typing this, I already know I haven’t done enough research, (or spent enough time on Duolingo learning French and Spanish) but I prefer to learn from my mistakes, and I’m sure there’ll be plenty along the way we can share with you. </p>
