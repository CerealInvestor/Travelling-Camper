After a Google search of "pretty french villages" we decided to stay in Saint-Céneri-le-Gérei.

We found an overnight parking area on the Contact Camper app which was next to a pretty river.

We went out and tested our French in a local restaurant and realised how little french we knew but we managed to stumble through and ended up with a lovely three course meal. At least we managed to get fed. Back to Duolingo it is!
